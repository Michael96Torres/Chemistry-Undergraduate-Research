# Chemistry Undergraduate Research Portfolio

## This is a small collection of work to highlight some of the laboratory and research skills that I developed during my undergraduate research opportunity at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  During this time I was able to develop microscale organic chemistry techniques and quantiative analysis of my lab results.
